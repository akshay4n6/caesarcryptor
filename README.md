# caesarcryptor - Text Encryption and Decryption Tool (GUI) using Caesar Cipher

This Python GUI application allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher technique. The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily input plaintext, specify the shift value, and encrypt/decrypt with a click.
- **Dark Mode:** Sleek and modern design for comfortable use.
- **Clear Option:** Quickly clear input and output fields.
- **Error Handling:** Ensures valid input for shift values.

## Getting Started
